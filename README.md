# CarDealershipApp

### Description 
This is a simple Java console application that simulates the operations of a car dealership. The dealership can manage a car lot where cars are added, purchased, and listed. The project is designed to demonstrate basic object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Key features include:

- Adding cars to the lot: Users can add cars to the dealership lot, up to a maximum capacity.
- Viewing inventory: Users can view the cars currently available in the lot.
- Purchasing cars: Users can specify the make and model of a car they wish to purchase. The program checks for availability, removes the car from the lot, and returns it to the user.

### Technologies Used 
Java: The programming language used to create this application.

Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA: Recommended IDEs for running and testing the application.

Git/GitHub: For version control and project management.

### Lessons Learned 
This project allowed me to practice several important programming skills:

Array Management: Handling collections of objects (cars) using an array, with checks for full or empty spots.

Method Chaining: Implementing and calling methods that interact with each other across classes, such as findSpecificModelCarInLot() and purchaseCar().

Conditional Logic: Writing logic to handle complex scenarios, like checking for the availability of specific cars, and updating the lot's status when a car is purchased.
